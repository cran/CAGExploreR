\title{
Extract a substrings from a larger string that contains delimiters
}
\description{
A long character string may contain data that is concatenated together with the use of delimiters. \code{Select} is a convenient wrapper for the \code{substr}-locate-\code{unlist} routine. 
}
\usage{
Select(x, split, which)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
character. Vector of strings to be split. 
}
  \item{split}{
character. Single character used as the delimiter on which to split. 
}
  \item{which}{
integer. After splitting, this number indicates which piece to keep. 
}
}
\details{
A combination of calls to \code{Select} can be used to perform quite complicated string parsing. 
}
\value{
character vector of substring extracted.
